Braille Translator


Initial Commit:

  A Simple Braille to English Text Translator.
  This is a Grade 1 braille translator. Build the shapes with the editor and to
  the left a single character will be displayed. To the right there are two
  modifiers, Number and CAPS, respectively.

  TODO:
   There is a lot of refactoring to be done. This is the most basic, functional
   example of the project. The individual components need to be split into their
   own classes, I'd like to split the lexicon into several lexicons for letters,
   numbers, and (although not implemented yet) special characters.

Update 1:

    Well, I made the site responsive in probably the grossest way possible. You
    have to reload the page when the window is resized, but on the surface it
    doesn't look too bad.
